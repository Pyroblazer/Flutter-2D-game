## App Demonstration
### Story
The story of the Coronavirus Social Distancing Game is that the player has to help the government stop the spread of Coronavirus by shooting rubber bullets (Warning Shots) to force those people that still don’t understand the importance of social distancing, and still going on a vacation, despite the government’s efforts to order people to go social distancing, to go social distancing back home.

Explained in a much more fun manner in the game:

> Stop the spread of Coronavirus by shooting rubber bullets to force those people that still don't understand the importance of social distancing, and still going on a vacation, despite the government's efforts to order people to go social distancing, to go social distancing back home

### How to Play
To play the game, press the Start game button in the main menu (which can be seen from the picture above), then press the screen anywhere to generate rubber bullets to convince the naughty people that were on vacation and currently may be infected from Coronavirus on their vacation from touching and visiting you, and make them go back home so that they are able to do Social Distancing back home.

The player loses when one of the people with the mask, going on a vacation, successfully gets near the player, which made the player get infected by the Coronavirus in which the people have gotten from their vacation.

Explained in a much more fun manner in the game:

> Other than that, just press Start game and \"press the screen anywhere\" to generate a rubber bullet on that exact same position where you pressed the screen. The bullet will fly forward starting from that position. Try to hit the naughty people that are still on vacation so that they'll go back home and do social distancing!
> 
> Be careful not to let those people go to the end of the path and touch you though... They seem to be wearing masks, and infected with Coronavirus, and you might get infected with Coronavirus that way...

### Exit Game

### Social Distancing Info
